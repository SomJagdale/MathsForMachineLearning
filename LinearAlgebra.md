# **Dot Product of Vectors and Its Purpose in Machine Learning**

The **dot product** (also known as the **scalar product**) is a fundamental operation in linear algebra with applications across multiple fields, including **physics, engineering, computer science, machine learning, economics, and signal processing**. Below are key applications of the dot product:

---

## **1. Physics & Engineering**
### **Work Done by a Force**  
The dot product is used to calculate the work done when a force is applied along a displacement.

\[
W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d} = |\mathbf{F}| |\mathbf{d}| \cos \theta
\]

where:  
- \( W \) is the work done,  
- \( \mathbf{F} \) is the applied force,  
- \( \mathbf{d} \) is the displacement,  
- \( \theta \) is the angle between them.

### **Electric and Magnetic Fields**  
- Used to compute power in AC circuits:

\[
P = V \cdot I \cos \theta
\]

- Helps determine how much of a force or field acts in a given direction.

---

## **2. Computer Science & Machine Learning**
### **Cosine Similarity in NLP & Data Science**  
Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors, which is widely used in **text analysis, recommendation systems, and clustering**.

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}|}
\]

where:  
- \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) are two vectors (e.g., word embeddings, feature vectors).  
- The result ranges from **-1 (opposite direction)** to **1 (identical direction)**.

### **3D Graphics & Computer Vision**  
- Used in **lighting calculations** (Phong reflection model).  
- Determines angles between surfaces for **shading and rendering**.

---

## **3. Robotics & Mechanics**
### **Joint Angles in Kinematics**  
- Used to compute angles between robotic arms for precise movements.

### **Torque & Rotation**  
- Helps in determining components of force along a particular direction.

---

## **4. Geometry & Trigonometry**
### **Projection of One Vector onto Another**  
- Used to determine how much of one vector lies along another.

### **Angle Between Two Vectors**  
- Essential in **navigation, physics, and structural analysis**.

---

## **5. Economics & Finance**
### **Portfolio Optimization**  
- Measures **correlation between different financial assets**.

### **Linear Regression**

# **Scalar and Vector Projection Using the Dot Product**
### **1. Scalar Projection (Component of One Vector onto Another)**
The **scalar projection** of vector \( \mathbf{A} \) onto another vector \( \mathbf{B} \) is the magnitude of the component of \( \mathbf{A} \) in the direction of \( \mathbf{B} \).

\[
\text{Scalar Projection of } \mathbf{A} \text{ on } \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{B}|}
\]

This gives a real number (scalar) representing how much \( \mathbf{A} \) lies along \( \mathbf{B} \).

#### **Example**
If  
\[
\mathbf{A} = (3, 4), \quad \mathbf{B} = (1, 2)
\]
then:

1. Compute the **dot product**:

\[
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = (3 \times 1) + (4 \times 2) = 3 + 8 = 11
\]

2. Compute the **magnitude of \( \mathbf{B} \)**:

\[
|\mathbf{B}| = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{5}
\]

3. Compute **scalar projection**:

\[
\frac{11}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

---

### **2. Vector Projection (Projection of \( \mathbf{A} \) onto \( \mathbf{B} \))**
The **vector projection** gives the actual vector component of \( \mathbf{A} \) in the direction of \( \mathbf{B} \).

\[
\text{Vector Projection of } \mathbf{A} \text{ on } \mathbf{B} = \left( \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{B}|^2} \right) \mathbf{B}
\]

This formula provides a **vector in the same direction as \( \mathbf{B} \)**.

#### **Example**
Using the same \( \mathbf{A} = (3, 4) \) and \( \mathbf{B} = (1, 2) \):

1. Compute \( |\mathbf{B}|^2 \):

\[
|\mathbf{B}|^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 = 5
\]

2. Compute **scalar factor**:

\[
\frac{11}{5} = 2.2
\]

3. Multiply by \( \mathbf{B} \):

\[
\mathbf{P} = 2.2 \times (1, 2) = (2.2, 4.4)
\]

| **Type**               | **Formula**                                                | **Output** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Scalar Projection**  | \( \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{B}|} \)    | A real number (scalar) |
| **Vector Projection**  | \( \left( \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{B}|^2} \right) \mathbf{B} \) | A vector in the same direction as \( \mathbf{B} \) |

A **basis function** is a fundamental building block used to represent more complex functions in terms of simpler, well-defined components. It comes up in **linear algebra, signal processing, machine learning, and numerical methods**.  

### **Why is it Important?**  
In many fields, we approximate or decompose a function using a **linear combination** of basis functions. These basis functions are usually chosen to make computations easier.

 **Examples of Basis Functions**  

1. **Fourier Series (Signal Processing & PDEs)**  
   - Uses **sine and cosine** as basis functions:  
     \[
     f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx) \right)
     \]
   - Any periodic function can be written as a sum of sines and cosines.

2. **Polynomial Basis (Curve Fitting & Regression)**  
   - Uses **polynomials** as basis functions:  
     \[
     f(x) = c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + c_3x^3 + \dots
     \]
   - This is used in polynomial regression.

3. **Wavelets (Image & Audio Processing)**  
   - Uses **wavelet functions** like Haar or Daubechies wavelets for analyzing signals at multiple scales.

4. **Neural Networks (Machine Learning)**  
   - Activation functions (e.g., **ReLU, sigmoid, tanh**) act as basis functions to approximate complex functions.

 **Connection to Dot Product**  
- In **signal processing**, a function can be projected onto basis functions using the **dot product**, which measures how much of one function aligns with another.
- For example, **Fourier coefficients** are computed using dot products with sine and cosine functions.

Letâ€™s break these concepts down in a simple way:  

---

## **1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
### **What are they?**
- **Eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors** are special properties of square matrices that reveal how the matrix transforms space.
- If we multiply a matrix \( A \) by a vector \( v \), and the result is just a **scaled** version of \( v \), then \( v \) is an **eigenvector**, and the scaling factor is its **eigenvalue** (\( \lambda \)).

### **Mathematical Definition**
For a square matrix \( A \):
\[
A v = \lambda v
\]
where:
- \( v \) is the **eigenvector** (a nonzero vector)
- \( \lambda \) is the **eigenvalue** (a scalar)

### **Why are they important?**
- Used in **machine learning** (e.g., PCA â€“ Principal Component Analysis)
- Helps in **stability analysis** of systems
- Used in **Googleâ€™s PageRank algorithm**  

### **Example**
If  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}
\]
has an eigenvector \( v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \),  
then \( A v = \lambda v \), meaning it just gets scaled.

To compute **eigenvalues**, solve:
\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0
\]
which gives the values of \( \lambda \).

---

## **2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
### **What is it?**
- SVD is a method of **decomposing** any (even non-square) matrix into three **special matrices**:
  \[
  A = U \Sigma V^T
  \]
  where:
  - \( U \) = Left **orthogonal** matrix (columns are eigenvectors of \( A A^T \))
  - \( \Sigma \) = **Diagonal matrix** of singular values (like eigenvalues but always positive)
  - \( V^T \) = Right **orthogonal** matrix (columns are eigenvectors of \( A^T A \))

### **Why is it useful?**
- **Dimensionality reduction** (PCA uses SVD)
- **Image compression** (JPEG uses it)
- **Solving ill-conditioned systems** (numerically stable than normal inverse)

### **Example**
If  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
\]
then:
- \( U \) and \( V \) are orthogonal
- \( \Sigma \) contains the **singular values**.

In Python, compute it using:
```python
U, S, VT = np.linalg.svd(A)
```

---

## **3. Norm of a Matrix**
### **What is it?**
- The **norm** of a matrix is a single number that represents the matrixâ€™s **size** or **magnitude**.

### **Common Norms**
1. **Frobenius Norm**: 
   \[
   ||A||_F = \sqrt{\sum A_{ij}^2}
   \]
   (Sum of squares of all elements)
   
2. **L1 Norm** (Max column sum):  
   \[
   ||A||_1 = \max \sum |A_{ij}|
   \]

3. **Lâˆž Norm** (Max row sum):  
   \[
   ||A||_{\infty} = \max \sum |A_{ij}|
   \]

### **Why is it useful?**
- Measures the **size of transformation** a matrix performs.
- Used in **optimization** and **error analysis**.

### **Example in NumPy**
```python
np.linalg.norm(A, 'fro')  # Frobenius norm
```

---

## **4. QR Decomposition**
### **What is it?**
- QR decomposition **factorizes** a matrix into:
  \[
  A = QR
  \]
  where:
  - \( Q \) = Orthogonal matrix (\( Q^T Q = I \))
  - \( R \) = Upper triangular matrix

### **Why is it useful?**
- Used in **solving linear systems** and **Least Squares Regression**.
- Basis for many **numerical algorithms**.

### **Example in NumPy**
```python
Q, R = np.linalg.qr(A)
```

---
