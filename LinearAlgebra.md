## Module I
### Relationship between machine learning, leaner algebra, and vector and matrices.
### Vectors 
### Vector addition, Vector substraction and vector scalling

## Module II
### Modulus and inner Product - Properties -- Commutitive, distributive over addition, associative over scalar multiplication
### Cosin and dot product 
### Projectin - Scalar projection and Vector projection
### Dot product of vectors 
Purpose in Machine Learning

**Scalar Projection:**
Helps in understanding how much one vector contributes to another, which can be useful in feature selection and dimensionality reduction.

**Vector Projection:**
Useful in algorithms that require directionality, such as gradient descent, where understanding the direction of the steepest descent is crucial for optimization.
